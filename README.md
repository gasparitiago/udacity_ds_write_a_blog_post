This repository contains the files for analyzing the data used in a Medium Blog Post: [What Airbnb data can tell about Rio De Janeiro](https://medium.com/@gasparitiago/what-airbnb-data-can-tell-about-rio-de-janeiro-4068f9d6becf). 

## Installations

To install all the dependencies of the project, just use pip:

```
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Project Motivation

In this repository I'm sharing the files used to finish the first project of the *Udacity Nanodegree: Become a Data Scientist*.

This project consists in just one Python Notebook called `Analyze.ipynb`that was used to get different information from the Rio de Janeiro Airbnb data.

It includes also the csv file used in the analysis and an image used to improve one of the analysis.

In this file, the data of Airbnb was used to answer three questions:

- Does the GeoLocation of a property affect its price?
- What amenities I can expect when going to Rio?
- A new host can estimate the price of a room just by describing it (Without any further research)?

A further analysis of the data, including the answer of these three questions were published in Medium, in the following link: https://medium.com/@gasparitiago/what-airbnb-data-can-tell-about-rio-de-janeiro-4068f9d6becf
